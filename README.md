# Aerospace Flight Simulations

This repo contains a collection of flight simulations built by me in my free time. The approach to dynamics and kinematics is taken from Frank Zipfel's Tensor Flight Dynamics. The list of simulations includes:

- ballistic launch of a point mass rocket in an Earth-centered reference frame (neglecting Coriolis & Centrifugal apparent forces)
- UAV cruising at mach 0.65, exhibiting the phugoid mode
